This project explores a better method of generating IHC slices from HE slices for better diagnosis of breast cancer. The attached paper describes the project methodology, as well as how to access the /data folder for training and testing the model. Users can replicate the results by working in the cvenv environment, and running model.ipynb on the /data folder containing train and test data.
